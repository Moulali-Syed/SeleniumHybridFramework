Agenda:

Framework archotecture:
AUT
Selenium webdriver
maven
testng 
log4j
extent reports
git
github
jenkins

Steps to create framework


1st component will be page object , where we have different pages
store all elements in a page , in a page object class
2nd User Actions stored in ActionDriver
3rd Utility Components
4th Config components
5th Folders

PageObjects  - all page object classes must be interlinked , page chaining model
  indexpage
  LoginPage
  HomePage
  ProductPage
  AddToCartpage
  OrderPage
this act as object repository


ActionDriver -  we need to perform different actions on a webpage
we write reusable methods
Scroll
Click
SendKeys
Select
Waits

Utility Components , we create a seperate package
we have util class - will store methods related to screenshot 
ExtentClass
Log4j
Listeners
DataProvider


Config components
pom.xml
extent-config.xml
log4j.xml
config.properties - to read constants from config.properties
testng.xml


Folders
  Testdata - to store excel sheet
  Screenshot folder
  Configuration
  Drivers
  Logs
  ExtentReports


on top of this above 5, we have Base class --> is extended by page object classes and ActionDriver
in base class , we have to read properties file [config file]
WebDriverInitialization
BeforeSuite
AfterSuite


Another component is our actual tests - testcase classes will extend base class
	like com.store.testcases
      we have seperate testcases for all the functionalities
		LoginPageTest
		HomePageTest
		AddToCartPageTest
		OrderTest	
		PaymentTest
here we put validations , assertions


Then we testng.xml file , to run our testcases
pom.xml [we configure test suite in pom.xml]

Git and GitHub
Jenkins CI Tool



we can divide our framework into 3 categories
 1.development phase
 2.Execution Phase
 3.Continuous Integration and maintenance
